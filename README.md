 Building a portifolio website
 --the first thing i did is that i linked the css into the index.html.
 --the second thing i uesed is the font awesome-cdnjs i chose this to use it later for icons in my project, then linked the cdnjs into the index.html.
 --the third thing i chose poppins google fonts, then i put the import inside the css file.
 --in css i put the * this sign mean everything or all the elements.
 --in css i chose to put the border box-sizing: border-box; because it make the border and the padding matches the element width: 100%, it just make the life easier. Then iput the scroll-behavior: smooth; to make the web smooth while scrolling.
 --in index.html i put the header inside the body to be more specific and simple, the semantic HTML. Inside the heade i gave it a class="logo" Michel then I put a nav class="navigation" inside the nav i put the three links.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --in css i put the 
 header { width=100% it mean full 100 in the header
      position: fixed; --> it mean the while scrolling the webpage the header will be same it will not disappear.
      z-index: 999; --> it mean while scrolling the webage cards that inside the web it will not cover the header.
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between; --> it means it make the child element that inside the header to be sapce betwwen the logo and the navigation.
      align-items: center; -->to put the things vertical inside the webpage.
      padding: 10px 200px; --> when i write just two value the first value mean top and bottom the second value meann left and right.
 }

 .logo {
    text-decoration: none; --> it mean it will takeaway the underline logo.
    text-tranform: uppercase; --> it will make the logo uppercase.
    font-weight: 700; --> it mean will make the logo thick.
    font-size: ##; --> it will make the logo more bigger.
 }

 .navigation {
    padding-left: ##; --> it mean will make the navigation more space between each other.
 }

 .navigation a:hover {
 color: #######; --> the hover mean it will change the color of navigation while you point it at the navigation.
 }

 --the fontawesome.com it gives you a lot of icons that you can copy the HTML elements.

 .main {
    min-height: 100vh: --> it mean that element height should atleast that high and it may increase or decrease it depends on the content if needs more room.
 }
